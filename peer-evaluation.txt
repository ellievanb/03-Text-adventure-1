Peer's repository: Noah Ramsey



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    I learned how my peer was able to record and display how many moves the
    user - in this case, me - has taken.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    I did not have a very good description for my project and will remember
    to do better on the README document of my own future projects.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    I would suggest that the creator add in an objective or create and end
    position, although they were clear why they did not create one.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    When you reach the edge of the map and can't go any further the game doesn't
    tell you that, it just keeps you in the same place and repeats the description
    until you type in a command to go in a different direction.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    There was nothing that was confusing to me.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    My peer makes it clear that the only thing to do in the game is to move around,
    however in the description they could have listed what specific words would be
    used to moce (north/south/east/west vs up/down/left/right).
 
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    The use of being able to record and display how many moves the user has taken
    and how many points they have gained was good.
